# OpenC2 using OpenDXL as message transport: Base Use Case
This is the base user case and system configuration which other threads will use as their initial condition. Although the base use case primarily explores a message transport solution some of the threads therein explore issues related to the OpenC2 language specification. At the time of this reference implementation (Jan 2017) the only OpenDXL broker in existence was embedded in McAfee’s E-Policy Orchestrator (EPO), which McAfee utilizes to send proprietary messages between its products. 

## OpenDXL 
OpenDXL utilizes a Publish/Subscribe model to allow clients to send and receive messages on selected topics. Additionally, OpenDXL utilizes identity certificates to restrict which clients can send or receive messages on a given topic.
The topic creation and configuration is all done at the OpenDXL broker. We can utilize this security mechanism to also create a simplistic type of authority structure. Topics can be created with an orchestrator as the only publisher and actuators under its purview as the only subscribers. 
Although this type of authority management worked for our simplistic reference implantation it is important to note that it has some limitations. It assumes that an orchestrator has access to “ALL” functionality subscribed actuators can provide. 
A theoretical argument has been made that a much more granular authority configuration could be achieved by utilizing controls at the orchestrator level to limit which users | command pairs are allowed. As of Jan 2018, no reference implementation has been created to demonstrate this approach. It is important to note that this workaround would still not address the actuator side of the authority problem but may still be a valid solution in some cases.

## Network
We set up the following network to develop our “OpenC2 utilizing OpenDXL as transport” reference implementation. This setup consisted of a Domain Controller (Windows 2012R2), two Windows 7 clients, and two Windows 10 clients. Additionally, we set up a McAfee EPO to establish the OpenDXL broker. Since we already had the EPO in place we decided to also utilize the McAfee EPO as a OpenC2 actuator.

## Orchestration
Two types of orchestration occur within this reference implementation, that which is started by the McAfee EPO, and that which is started by the independent OpenC2 orchestrator. Much of the orchestration that occurs within the McAfee EPO is proprietary to the products within its purview. Therefore, for the time being, or until we discuss orchestrator-to-orchestrator communications, we will consider the McAfee suite as a ”black box” and treat it as an actuator for our OpenC2 orchestrator to control.
The OpenC2 Orchestrator was fundamentally simple. It is assumed all sensing, sense making, and decision making had been done prior to the creation of an OpenC2 message.  

## Actuation
Because McAfee EPO did not at the time have native support for OpenC2 we created a small service to bridge this gap. This service was configured to receive OpenC2 messages by subscribing to the appropriate OpenDXL topics. Once the service received an OpenC2 message it translated it into the appropriate McAfee proprietary commands utilizing a variety of McAfee provided wrappers. 

## Serialization
At the time of this reference implementation no commonly agreed upon serialization existed. Therefore, in an effort to advance the conversation we created our own serialization utilizing JSON as a format. Since then a serialization utilizing JSON has been put forth by others in the committee which is admittedly better than our initial stab at it.

## Transport

As mentioned previously we are utilizing OpenDXL as a transport layer message fabric. There are many strategies for setting up a topic structure. However, since we only had one orchestrator we decided to only create two topics, one called “OpenC2/Action”, and the other “OpenC2/Response”. Had we had multiple orchestrators we would have created these 2 topics for each of them, distinguishing them from each other by orchestrator name such as “OpenC2/Borg/Action”.

## Authorization
To create a rough authority structure with the tools we had, we utilized OpenDXL’s ability to limit, via certificates, who can publish and/or subscribe to a given topic. We configured the broker so that only our orchestrator could publish content to the “OpenC2/Action” topic and subscribe to the “OpenC2/Response” topic. Conversely, we also configured the broker to only allow actuators under the purview of our orchestrator to subscribe to the “OpenC2/Action” topic and publish to the “OpenC2/Response” topic. In taking these actions, we hoped to do two things: one limit the orchestrator presences, and two limit who can control a given actuator.
