# Set Reputation of a Malicious File

## Objective
This use case shows the OpenC2 commands involved in setting the reputation of a malicious file. In doing so we take advantage of preconfigured courses of actions in McAfee EPO. 

## Initial Conditions
![Network](https://github.com/dmg2/openc2-lsc-usecases/blob/master/G2/images/network_basecase.PNG)

Initial condition is the configuration described in 00.opendxl_basecase.md. The OpenC2 orchestrator is ready to publish commands through OpenDXL and the McAfee EPO, via the gap bridging service, is waiting to be commanded.

## Scenario
The OpenC2 Orchestrator is subscribed to a Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) feed. As part of its standard rules of engagement the orchestrator has been configured to act on any received STIX message involving malware. The orchestrator will create an OpenC2 message related to this threat and publish it to the OpenDXL topic “OpenC2/Action”. The message should be received by the gap bridging service created to help McAfee EPO translate OpenC2 messages. Utilizing McAfee wrappers, the gap bridging service translates the OpenC2 commands into the appropriate McAfee commands.
The McAfee EPO along with its Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) has the capability to brand files with reputations. Additionally, you can configure courses of actions to be taken for each of these reputations. In our instance the reputation “known malicious” has been preconfigured to take these three actions: stop the current process, deny future execution, and quarantine the file. 
We should be able to take advantage of this smart feature rather than having to send individual stop, deny, and quarantine commands. Therefore, we decided to send a single OpenC2 command that invoked the reputation feature.

## OpenC2 Commands
```json
{
	"action": "set",
	"target": "file",
	"options":{
		"filename": "evil.exe",
		"reputation": "Known Malicious",
		"hashes":[
			{
			"hash": "4EC1127BEF4D7E1786A04D021FA8A67F",
			"type": "md5"
			}
		]
	}
}
```
Here we utilized the “SET” action to set the reputation of a file to “Known Malicious”. Once this is done all host-based clients commanded by McAfee EPO should execute the preconfigured network security policy.    

## Definition of Done
The malicious file is handled properly according to network security policy. In our case stopped, denied, and quarantined. 

## Endnotes
We did not specify an actuator in the OpenC2 command because at the time we only had one actuator to work with. In hindsight it may have been better to specify an actuator. It is likely that a device like McAfee EPO will have multiple actuator profiles and it is not entirely clear what is being “SET” in this command.
