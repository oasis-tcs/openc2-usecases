### 2.6-SCAP Goals & Objectives
Develop OpenC2 profiles to support interactions within the [SCAPv2](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol-v2/)
[Data Collection Architecture](../DoD/07-scap/scap-v2-data-collection-architecture.md).  The architecture has two main use cases:

* Point-in-time Information Collection
* Ongoing Monitoring Against a Baseline

An initial PoC could demonstrate an Application collecting SBoM information from a Manager or Repository using OpenC2, in accordance with
the [SCAP Prototype Architecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11EtTqBsSlfGVnjmudNrTSTpk3-tUUxn90AuucZpenD8).  The SCAP "Application"
corresponds to the "Obtain Current SBOM" box in the SBOM PoC [scenario flowchart](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-usecases/tree/master/SBOM-PoC#11-vision)
and is a great example of how PoC components/interactions are defined and how questions to be addressed by the PoC are identified.
